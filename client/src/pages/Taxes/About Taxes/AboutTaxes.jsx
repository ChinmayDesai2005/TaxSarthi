          It was 7 minutes after midnight. The dog was lying on the grass in the
          middle of the lawn in front of Mrs Shears' house. Its eyes were
          closed. It looked as if it was running on its side, the way dogs run
          when they think they are chasing a cat in a dream. But the dog was not
          running or asleep. The dog was dead. There was a garden fork sticking
          out of the dog. The points of the fork must have gone all the way
          through the dog and into the ground because the fork had not fallen
          over. I decided that the dog was probably killed with the fork because
          I could not see any other wounds in the dog and I do not think you
          would stick a garden fork into a dog after it had died for some other
          reason, like cancer for example, or a road accident. But I could not
          be certain about this.

          I went through Mrs Shears’ gate, closing it behind me. I walked onto
          her lawn and knelt beside the dog. I put my hand on the muzzle of the
          dog. It was still warm. The dog was called Wellington. It belonged to
          Mrs Shears who was our friend. She lived on the opposite side of the
          road, two houses to the left. Wellington was a poodle. Not one of the
          small poodles that have hairstyles but a big poodle. It had curly
          black fur, but when you got close you could see that the skin
          underneath the fur was a very pale yellow, like chicken. I stroked
          Wellington and wondered who had killed him, and why. 3 My name is
          Christopher John Francis Boone. I know all the countries of the world
          and their capital cities and every prime number up to 7,057. Eight
          years ago, when I first met Siobhan, she showed me this picture [sad
          face] and I knew that it meant ‘sad,’ which is what I felt when I
          found the dead dog. Then she showed me this picture [smiley face] and
          I knew that it meant ‘happy’, like when I’m reading about the Apollo
          space missions, or when I am still awake at 3 am or 4 am in the
          morning and I can walk up and down the street and pretend that I am
          the only person in the whole world.
